# filepath
### `which` for open files

Do you drag file handles from app titlebars into your terminal a lot?
And you consider yourself a hardened keyboard warrior and don't like
using the mouse unless absolutely necessary?

## Without `filepath`

Sure, you might say "I'd just type and tab complete that shit." But let's
just imagine that file is really deep in the project hierarchy
or just really damn annoying to autocomplete because there's a billion
things with the same prefixes.

Now, let's take a look at your coding life with `filepath`.

## With `filepath`

"Holy shit, that's amazing!" you say, "But what about if I have more
than one window? Which one does it choose?"

You get a choice! `filepath` is democratic like that.

## Want it?

You can grab it from the [downloads page](https://github.com/chendo/filepath/downloads) or build it yourself.

This requires Snow Leopard (10.6) and if you somehow don't have Snow
Leopard, upgrade already.

## Why?

I like being efficient. I'd rather spend an hour or two writing a tool
making me more efficient in the long run than waste two seconds every
time I drag a file into the terminal.

## Contribute

Fork and send me pull requests! You might be able to tell that I don't
code Objective-C/C very often and so I'm happy to learn better ways of
doing things.
